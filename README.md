# Portfolio
This repository is used for my portfolio. This portfolio is made for for our study Data Science for Biology 2. In this portfolio, I will be making exercises that require basic knowledge of Rstudio and Git.  

Within every folder, the correct Rmarkdown is provided for every assignment. If there are data files needed to run the code, the files will be included in the same folder.
